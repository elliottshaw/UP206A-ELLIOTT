# UP206A Intro to GIS and Spatial Data Science  
## hELLO.
### Welcome to my Data Science Project Space
Hi I'm Elliott and I'm a first year MURP student. I grew up in Vancouver, Canada and moved to LA in September. I have a degree in Human Geography from the University of British Columbia and my planning-related interests lie primarily in public space and active transportation infrastructure. I enjoy spending as much time as I can give to being outside; cycling, walking, hiking, climbing, badminton, tennis, drinking, whatever.

### Project Ideas
I would like to focus on the built environment and how we experience/move through urban spaces. Potential project ideas would be focused around street lamp coverage, canopy coverage, public spaces for sitting or socializing and recreation, etc. 

### Course Description and Personal Objectives
My objectives in this course are to learn how to code and expand upon my knowledge of GIS. 
<br> Through this course we will be exploring data science tools, getting a foundational understanding of Python and spatial data science. This course prepares us for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data’s journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—and how it enables and advances our research from a data science perspective.
